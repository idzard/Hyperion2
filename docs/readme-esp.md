# Hyperion 2 on Esp32 / Hyperion hardware

To build for esp32 you need to be able to build the project on your own machine first. 
To setup your mac, follow the installation steps in the [Macos guide](readme-macos.md).
For other operating systems there is no documentation yet.

Once you can build the project to run locally, you can follow these steps to build for the esp32 as well. 

## Installation

#### 1. Install esp-idf following the
[Esp-idf installation guide](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32s3/get-started/linux-macos-setup.html)

#### 2. Update your .zprofile
Add a line to your ~/.zprofile that sets IDF_DIR to your esp-idf folder. If you used the path suggested in the esp-idf documentation, this script will set it for you:

```sh
echo "export IDF_DIR=$HOME/esp/esp-idf" >> ~/.zprofile  
```

#### 3. Switch to the correct esp-idf version

Follow these steps to checkout version 5.1. ([Documentation](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/versions.html#updating-release-branch))
```sh
cd $IDF_PATH
git fetch
git checkout release/v5.1
git pull
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

#### 4. Finished
That's it. If these steps didn't work for you, you can try this:

- I had to run `python esp-idf/tools/idf_tools.py install` after the update. This was mentioned in the error messages.

- If you have built projects before, and now changed the esp-idf version number, you might need to delete the build folder in your project to get rid of errors.

## Running

```
cd examples/hello_world
build esp32
run esp32
```

## Change sdkconfig
You might want to change esp-idf configurations if you are going to write code that accesses esp-idf directly. 
If you want to do so, follow these steps: Create an sdkconfig that works for you. E.g. by running `idf.py menuconfig` in one of the example projects. Make sure to run `idf.py set-target esp32s3` first to set the correct target. Then run `idf.py save-defconfig` to create an sdkconfig.defaults. Copy the contents of this file and add it to the sdkconfig.defaults in the platform folder if you want these settings to available to all new projects in this platform, or create a new sdkconfig.defaults in your project folder and paste it there. The build system will detect changes automatically and build a new sdkconfig for you.
